# ECG Based Biometric Recognition 
 This our DSP Project from Level-3 Term-1
 
Biometric recognition is a data system that allows a person to
be identified based on some of their most important
physiological and behavioral traits such as fingerprint,
retina, and facial recognition. Despite their
widespread use, these methods are vulnerable to forgery
attempts. As a result, in recent years, physiological signal-based
recognition has been drawing attention. Among these signals,
ECG is the most common one. we propose a Machine Learning-based method of
ECG biometric recognition system in this project.
